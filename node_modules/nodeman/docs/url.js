,"\t"
,"\tParsed URL objects have some or all of the following fields, depending on"
,"\twhether or not they exist in the URL string. Any parts that are not in the URL"

,"\t"
,"\t`'http://user:pass@host.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash'`".yellow
,"\t"
,"\t* `href`: The full URL that was originally parsed. Both the protocol and host are lowercased."
,"\t"
,"\t  Example: `'http://user:pass@host.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash'`".red
,"\t* `protocol`: The request protocol, lowercased."

,"\t* `search`: The 'query string' portion of the URL, including the leading question mark."
